\section{Problem Statement}
All details for this project will be provided by a competition titled "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" introduced by kaggle.com (\cite{titanic}).





\textbf{Project Description and Statement}

This project will build a predictive model that aims to find the type of people who are going to survive the sinking of the Titanic, a well renowned ship that was believed to be "unsinkable" until it hit an iceberg in 1912, resulting in the death of 1502 passengers/crew.

This project will utilize passenger information, such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc., to determine what sorts of groups were more likely to survive than others during the sinking of the Titanic.

\section{Evaluation Metrics \& Expected Outcomes}
	When looking at the evaluation metrics of the Titanic problem, the problem uses binary classification in order to show if a passenger survives the tragedy. In this instance, if a passenger is marked with a 1 this means they survived and a 0 would mean that they did not survive. When wanting to make a prediction on whether or not a passenger will survive there are a few metrics that we could use in order to find out the most likely outcome for the passenger.
	The first metric to look at would be the gender of the passengers. When looking at the data it seems that female passengers had a much larger survival rate than men passengers. Only about 20\% of men survived aboard the Titanic while around 75\% of women survived. This is largely due to the fact that women and children were the number one priority to get on the lifeboats first. Passenger class is another metric that affects the survival rate of passengers. First class passengers were more likely to survive in the event of sinking due to being higher up in the ship than second or third class passengers. Age is another factor that helped in the survival rate for passengers on the Titanic. As stated earlier, women and children were the highest priority passengers to get onto the lifeboats. This had a large impact on the survival rate for children aboard the Titanic and gave them a better chance at surviving. The ports in which passengers had boarded the Titanic from do show a correlation to survival. This is a socio-economic factor that does link back to the class of passengers as we can see a connection between the ports passengers boarded from to a class level on the boat. For example, Cherbourg has a lot of passengers that boarded into the first class.which means that they had a higher chance of surviving than passengers that boarded from Queenstown which had more third class passengers than Cherbourg. These are just some of the metrics that can be used to find expected outcomes in the event of the Titanic.
